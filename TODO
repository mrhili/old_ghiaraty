---------Indicate the preferred URL with the rel="canonical" link element
Suppose you want https://blog.example.com/dresses/green-dresses-are-awesome/ to be the preferred URL, even though a variety of URLs can access this content. You can indicate this to search engines as follows:

Mark up the canonical page and any other variants with a rel="canonical" link element.
Add a <link> element with the attribute rel="canonical" to the <head> section of these pages: 
<link rel="canonical" href="https://blog.example.com/dresses/green-dresses-are-awesome" />
This indicates the preferred URL to use to access the green dress post, so that the search results will be more likely to show users that URL structure. (Note: We attempt to respect this, but cannot guarantee this in all cases.)

Avoid errors: use absolute paths rather than relative paths with the rel="canonical" link element.

Use this structure:  https://www.example.com/dresses/green/greendresss.html
Not this structure: /dresses/green/greendress.html).
